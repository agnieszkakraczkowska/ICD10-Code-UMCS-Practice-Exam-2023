- ICD Code Description Lookup: The project enables the retrieval of descriptions for ICD-10 medical codes.

- Optimized Data Handling: Two classes are provided, `ICDCodeTabularOptimizedForTime` and `ICDCodeTabularOptimizedForMemory`, for efficient data processing. 

- Handling Indentation: The code effectively handles cases where ICD-10 codes are preceded by whitespace in the data source.

With this project, you can easily look up descriptions for ICD-10 medical codes and choose between memory-efficient or time-efficient data handling methods.
